        <p>
          Anshika Verma is the chief coder of this project.
          She played a major role in designing all the webpages specially the home page and the scripting of login
          page.
          Anshika was the first one to show the team what were all the options that we had at that time.
          In the times when Team was confused over what should be done and what was actually achievable, she found out
          the ways by her
          ability to search that what was actually that we were looking for.

        <h2>Anushka Jain</h2>
        <p>
          Anushka Jain is the associate coder who played an important role in the developmenmt of the login-signup page,
          most of the Css included in that page was imagined and brought to life by Anushka herself.
          She had the vision and worked hard to be able to make it work.
          This project would have been just a dull empty html document without her work done on Css.
          She always maintained her cool no-matter how many times team told her to change her designs but always worked
          hard to prove her worth to the team and always came out more polished and shining with the designs even more
